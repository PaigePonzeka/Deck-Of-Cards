A Simple deck of cards implemented with Xcode and Objective C.
Supports a Deck of Card Objects, Shuffles, gets cards information stored in an array.

Each Deck creates and Array of Card Objects.
Each card has a suit and a type.
Each card has a power ranking (good for comparing hands)
Each card has a value (good for games like blackjack)
A deck can be generated and shuffles, cards can be grabbed from the top of the deck.

This was created on the fly so feel free to use and improve upon it!
I commented as best I could so hopefully it makes sense to you!
There's also some same code in the Test.m main method. Once you download the code it should automatically run a new deck for you and pick out the card.

Please see the source code for further comments and instructions.
